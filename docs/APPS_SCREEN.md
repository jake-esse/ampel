# Apps/Ampel Screen Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the `/apps/ampel` screen with ownership incentives, disclosures, and a discussion board feature.

---

## Current State

**Existing `/apps/ampel` Screen:**
- Header with back button
- App icon and title section
- Two-paragraph description about Ampel's equity-sharing model
- Basic layout structure established

**Available Components to Reuse:**
- Ownership incentive boxes from `EquityIntro.tsx` (4 cards showing share amounts)
- Disclosure accordions from `Disclosures.tsx` (7 sections)
- `Accordion` component in `src/components/ui/Accordion.tsx`

---

## Goals

1. **Condense Description**: Reduce current two-paragraph description to one concise paragraph
2. **Add Ownership Incentives Section**: Display the 4 share-earning cards below description
3. **Add Disclosures Section**: Display disclosure accordions below incentives
4. **Add Discussion Board**: Bare-bones Q&A system with admin-only responses

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Infrastructure

#### Objective
Create database table and helper functions for discussion board functionality.

#### Database Table: `ampel_questions`

**Schema Requirements:**
```
Table: ampel_questions

Columns:
- id: uuid (primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
- user_id: uuid (foreign key to auth.users.id, not null)
- question_text: text (not null, check: length <= 500)
- response_text: text (nullable)
- responded_at: timestamp with time zone (nullable)
- responded_by: uuid (foreign key to auth.users.id, nullable)
- created_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())
- updated_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())

Indexes:
- Index on user_id for faster user queries
- Index on created_at for ordering

RLS Policies:
1. SELECT: Users can read all questions and responses (authenticated users only)
2. INSERT: Authenticated users can insert questions (user_id must match auth.uid())
3. UPDATE: Only admin user (specified by ADMIN_USER_ID env var) can update response_text and responded_at
4. DELETE: Only question author or admin can delete

Constraints:
- question_text must be 1-500 characters
- When response_text is set, responded_at and responded_by must also be set
```

#### Environment Variable

**File: `.env.local`**
```
# Add this line with the founder's user ID
VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID=<founder_user_id>
```

**Note:** The VITE_ prefix makes it available in the client via `import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID`

#### Database Helper Functions

**File: `src/lib/database/ampel-questions.ts`**

Functions needed:
1. `createQuestion(userId: string, questionText: string)` - Insert new question
2. `listQuestions()` - Fetch all questions ordered by created_at DESC (newest first)
3. `respondToQuestion(questionId: string, responseText: string, respondedBy: string)` - Update question with response
4. `deleteQuestion(questionId: string)` - Delete a question
5. `isAdmin(userId: string)` - Check if user ID matches admin env var

#### Type Definitions

**File: `src/types/database.ts`**

Add type:
```typescript
export type AmpelQuestion = {
  id: string
  user_id: string
  question_text: string
  response_text: string | null
  responded_at: string | null
  responded_by: string | null
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
}
```

---

### Phase 2: Update AppsAmpel Screen Layout

#### Objective
Restructure the AppsAmpel screen to include condensed description, ownership incentives, and disclosures.

#### File: `src/pages/AppsAmpel.tsx`

**Current Structure:**
```
- Header (with back button)
- Main content
  - App icon & title
  - Description (2 paragraphs)
```

**New Structure:**
```
- Header (with back button + discussion icon)
- Main content (scrollable)
  - App icon & title
  - Description (1 condensed paragraph)
  - Ownership Incentives section
  - Disclosures section
```

#### Detailed Requirements

**1. Header Updates:**
- Keep existing back button (left)
- Keep empty center
- Add discussion board icon (right) - use `MessageCircle` from lucide-react
- Icon button should have same styling as back button (44x44 touch target)
- Icon opens discussion board modal (Phase 3)

**2. Condensed Description:**
Replace existing two paragraphs with single condensed version:
- Combine key message: Ampel is user-owned, 50% equity reserved for users
- Keep core value proposition about building a future where users own the companies they help grow
- Approximately 2-3 sentences total

**3. Ownership Incentives Section:**

**Location:** Directly below description

**Section Structure:**
```
- Section title: "Ownership Incentives" (text-xl, font-semibold, mb-4)
- Four cards in vertical stack (gap-3)
- Each card matches design from EquityIntro.tsx
```

**Card Data to Display:**

- Description: "Bonus shares for using a referral code"
```

**Card Styling Requirements:**
- Same exact styling as EquityIntro.tsx cards
- White background, border-[#E5E3DD]
- Large share numbers (text-3xl) right-aligned
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

**4. Disclosures Section:**

**Location:** Below ownership incentives section (with appropriate spacing, mb-6)

**Section Structure:**
```
- Section title: "Disclosures" (text-xl, font-semibold, mb-4)
- Accordion component with all 7 sections from Disclosures.tsx
```

**Disclosure Sections to Display:**
1. Offering Process
2. Company Information
3. Financial Terms
4. Risk Factors
5. Securities Description
6. Intermediary Details
7. Investor Rights

**Note:** Use the exact same content and Accordion component from `src/pages/Disclosures.tsx`

**5. Spacing & Layout:**
- Consistent spacing between sections (space-y-6)
- Maintain safe area handling for scrollable content
- All content should be within max-w-4xl container
- Proper paddingBottom for iOS home indicator

---

### Phase 3: Discussion Board Modal Component

#### Objective
Create a full-screen modal overlay for the discussion board with question posting and admin response capabilities.

#### Component: `src/components/ampel/DiscussionBoard.tsx`

**Props:**
```typescript
interface DiscussionBoardProps {
  isOpen: boolean
  onClose: () => void
}
```

**Modal Behavior:**
- Full-screen overlay (fixed position, z-50)
- Semi-transparent backdrop (bg-black/50)
- White modal content container with rounded corners
- Slide-in animation from bottom (mobile-native feel)
- Tap outside or close button to dismiss
- Prevent scroll on body when modal is open

**Modal Layout Structure:**
```
- Backdrop overlay (dismisses on click)
- Modal container (doesn't dismiss on click)
  - Header
    - Title: "Discussion Board"
    - Close button (X icon)
  - Question input form (if not admin)
  - Questions list (scrollable)
    - Each question card
      - User display name
      - Question text
      - Timestamp
      - Response (if exists)
      - Response form (admin only, if no response)
```

#### Question Input Form (Users Only)

**Visibility:** Show only to non-admin users

**Layout:**
```
- Textarea input
  - Placeholder: "Ask a question about Ampel..."
  - Max length: 500 characters
  - Character counter (e.g., "245/500")
  - Auto-resize as user types
  - Rounded border, proper padding
- Submit button
  - Text: "Post Question"
  - Disabled when empty or loading
  - Loading state: "Posting..."
```

**Behavior:**
- Input validation: 1-500 characters
- On submit: Create question in database
- Clear input after successful submission
- Show success feedback (toast or inline message)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Haptic feedback on submit

#### Questions List

**Layout:**
```
- Scrollable container
- Each question in a card (border-[#E5E3DD], rounded-xl, p-4)
- Ordered newest first
- Empty state when no questions exist
```

**Question Card Structure:**
```
- Header row:
  - User display name (or "Anonymous User" if null)
  - Timestamp (relative, e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Question text (text-base, text-gray-900)
- Response section (if exists):
  - Divider line
  - "Ampel Team" label
  - Response text
  - Response timestamp
```

**Question Card for Admin (when no response exists):**
```
- All above elements
- Plus: Response form
  - Textarea for response
  - Max length: 1000 characters
  - Character counter
  - "Post Response" button
  - Cancel button
```

**Admin Response Behavior:**
- Only admin can see response form
- Response form appears inline in question card
- On submit: Update question with response
- Show admin's display name with response
- Timestamp when response posted
- Success feedback after posting

**Empty State:**
```
- Centered message
- Icon (MessageCircle from lucide-react)
- Text: "No questions yet"
- Subtext: "Be the first to ask a question about Ampel"
```

#### Mobile Considerations

- Safe area handling (paddingTop, paddingBottom)
- Smooth animations (slide-in transition)
- Proper keyboard handling (modal shifts up when keyboard appears)
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44x44 minimum)
- Swipe-to-dismiss (optional enhancement, not required for MVP)

---

### Phase 4: Integration & State Management

#### Objective
Connect all components, handle state, and ensure smooth user experience.

#### AppsAmpel State Management

**State needed in `AppsAmpel.tsx`:**
```typescript
- isDiscussionOpen: boolean (controls modal visibility)
- User authentication context (from useAuth hook)
```

**Handlers:**
```typescript
- handleOpenDiscussion(): void - Sets isDiscussionOpen to true, adds haptic feedback
- handleCloseDiscussion(): void - Sets isDiscussionOpen to false
```

#### DiscussionBoard State Management

**State needed in `DiscussionBoard.tsx`:**
```typescript
- questions: AmpelQuestion[] (list of all questions)
- loading: boolean (initial load state)
- questionInput: string (user's question text)
- submittingQuestion: boolean (question submission state)
- respondingTo: string | null (question ID being responded to)
- responseInput: Record<string, string> (response text by question ID)
- submittingResponse: Record<string, boolean> (response submission states)
```

**Effects:**
```typescript
- useEffect: Fetch questions when modal opens
- useEffect: Set up real-time subscription for new questions/responses
- useEffect: Clean up subscriptions on unmount
```

**Real-time Updates:**
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Subscribe to INSERT events on ampel_questions
- Subscribe to UPDATE events on ampel_questions
- Update questions list in real-time when changes occur
- Show indicator when new question appears

#### Error Handling

**Scenarios to handle:**
1. Failed to load questions - Show error message with retry button
2. Failed to post question - Show error toast, keep input text
3. Failed to post response - Show error toast, keep response text
4. Network offline - Disable form, show offline indicator
5. Validation errors - Inline error messages below inputs
6. Database errors - Generic user-friendly message

#### Loading States

**Initial load:**
- Show skeleton cards while loading questions
- Use same pattern as ConversationSkeleton.tsx

**Submitting question:**
- Disable submit button
- Show "Posting..." text
- Disable textarea

**Submitting response:**
- Disable response button
- Show "Posting..." text
- Disable response textarea

#### Success Feedback

**After posting question:**
- Clear input field
- Scroll to top to show new question
- Optional: Show success toast "Question posted"

**After posting response:**
- Clear response input
- Close response form
- Optional: Show success toast "Response posted"

---

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

**No new dependencies required** - all functionality uses existing packages:
- React hooks for state management
- Supabase client for database operations
- Lucide React for icons (MessageCircle, X)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Capacitor Haptics for feedback

### File Structure

```

### Supabase Real-time Subscription Pattern

```typescript
// Pattern to follow (from existing conversation code)
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('ampel_questions_changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'ampel_questions'
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events
    }
  )
  .subscribe()

// Clean up on unmount
return () => {
  subscription.unsubscribe()
}
```

## Notes for Claude Code

### Context You'll Need

**Project Structure:**
- This is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Capacitor mobile app
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend (auth, database, real-time)
- Mobile-first design with iOS safe area handling
- Existing design system established (see other pages for patterns)

**Code Style to Match:**
- Functional components with TypeScript
- React hooks for state management
- Async/await for database operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Comments for complex logic
- Mobile-native patterns (haptics, safe areas, touch targets)

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `/src/pages/EquityIntro.tsx` - For ownership incentive card styling
- `/src/pages/Disclosures.tsx` - For disclosure accordion content
- `/src/components/ui/Accordion.tsx` - Reusable accordion component
- `/src/lib/database/conversations.ts` - Pattern for database helpers
- `/src/lib/database/waitlist.ts` - Pattern for form submissions
- `/src/hooks/useConversations.ts` - Pattern for real-time subscriptions

**Design Patterns to Follow:**
- Use `border-[#E5E3DD]` for borders
- Use `bg-[#FDFCFA]` for page backgrounds
- Use `bg-white` for card backgrounds
- Use `text-gray-900` for primary text
- Use `text-gray-600` for secondary text
- Use `rounded-xl` for cards
- Use `min-h-[44px]` for touch targets
- Use `active:scale-95` for button press feedback
- Include `env(safe-area-inset-top/bottom)` in styling

**Environment Setup:**
- Admin user ID will be provided by founder
- Needs to be added to `.env.local` with `VITE_` prefix
- Access in code via `import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID`

### Database Migration

**Create migration file pattern:**
```
Filename: supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_ampel_questions.sql

Include in migration:
1. CREATE TABLE statement with all columns
2. CREATE INDEX statements
3. ALTER TABLE for RLS
4. CREATE POLICY statements for each policy
5. Comments on table and columns
```

### RLS Policy Examples

**Reference existing patterns in Supabase:**
- Check `conversations` table policies
- Check `messages` table policies
- Match authentication patterns

**Admin check pattern:**
```sql
-- For UPDATE policy
CREATE POLICY "Admin can respond to questions"
ON ampel_questions
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = responded_by OR responded_by IS NULL)
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT id FROM auth.users 
    WHERE email = 'founder@email.com'  -- Will need actual admin email
  )
);
```

### Real-time Subscription Best Practices

1. Always clean up subscriptions on unmount
2. Handle all event types (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
3. Update local state optimistically when possible
4. Show loading states during subscription setup
5. Handle subscription errors gracefully
6. Reconnect automatically on network restore

### Accessibility Considerations

1. All interactive elements have aria-labels
2. Focus management for modal (trap focus inside when open)
3. Keyboard navigation support (Enter to submit, Esc to close)
4. Screen reader announcements for real-time updates
5. Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

These features are explicitly NOT in scope for this implementation but may be added later:

1. **Question Upvoting** - Users can upvote questions to surface popular topics
2. **Question Categories** - Tag questions with topics (technical, equity, general)
3. **Search Functionality** - Search through questions and responses
4. **Notification System** - Notify question author when admin responds
5. **Rich Text Responses** - Allow markdown formatting in responses
6. **Question Threading** - Allow follow-up questions on responses
7. **Admin Dashboard** - Separate admin view for managing questions
8. **Question Analytics** - Track most asked topics, response times
9. **File Attachments** - Allow users to attach screenshots to questions
10. **Multi-admin Support** - Allow multiple team members to respond

---

## Success Criteria

This implementation will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ AppsAmpel screen displays condensed description, ownership incentives, and disclosures
2. ✅ Discussion board modal opens/closes smoothly
3. ✅ Users can post questions (500 char limit)
4. ✅ All questions visible to all users in real-time
5. ✅ Admin can respond to questions
6. ✅ Responses appear immediately to all users
7. ✅ All mobile UX patterns followed (haptics, safe areas, animations)
8. ✅ Error handling covers all edge cases
9. ✅ Code matches existing project patterns and style
10. ✅ No new dependencies added

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed:** 2025-10-29

**What Was Implemented:**
1. **Database Migration:** `create_ampel_questions`
   - Created `ampel_questions` table with all required columns
   - Added constraints for text length (1-500 chars for questions)
   - Added response integrity constraint (ensures all response fields set together)
   - Created indexes on `user_id` and `created_at` for performance
   - Enabled Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Created RLS policies:
     - SELECT: All authenticated users can read questions/responses
     - INSERT: Users can insert their own questions only
     - DELETE: Users can delete their own questions
     - UPDATE: Allows response updates with admin check enforced in app layer
   - Added auto-updating `updated_at` trigger
   - Added table and column comments for documentation

2. **Database Helper Functions:** `src/lib/database/ampel-questions.ts`
   - `isAdmin(userId)` - Check if user is admin via VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID env var
   - `createQuestion(userId, questionText)` - Create new question with validation
   - `listQuestions()` - Fetch all questions ordered newest first
   - `respondToQuestion(questionId, responseText, respondedBy)` - Admin response with validation
   - `deleteQuestion(questionId, userId)` - Delete with permission check
   - `getQuestion(id)` - Fetch single question by ID
   - All functions include error handling and input validation

3. **TypeScript Type:** `src/types/database.ts`
   - Added `AmpelQuestion` type with all fields from database schema

**Files Created:**
- `/Users/jamesesse/ampel/src/lib/database/ampel-questions.ts` (new)
- Database migration via Supabase MCP (applied successfully)

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/jamesesse/ampel/src/types/database.ts` (added AmpelQuestion type)

**Key Decisions:**
- Admin check is enforced both in RLS policy and application layer for defense in depth
- Using VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID client-side env var for admin checks in application
- Response fields have integrity constraint to ensure all set together
- Included getQuestion() helper for future use even though not in original spec

**Testing:**
- Migration applied successfully to Supabase
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- All helper functions follow existing codebase patterns

**Next Steps:**
- User needs to add `VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID=<admin_user_id>` to `.env.local`
- Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Update AppsAmpel Screen Layout

### Next Steps for User

**Before Testing:**
1. **IMPORTANT:** Add your admin user ID to `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID=<your_user_id_from_supabase>
   ```
   To get your user ID:
   - Log into the Ampel app
   - Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Copy your user ID

2. Restart the dev server after adding the environment variable

**Testing the Feature:**
1. Navigate to `/apps/ampel` in the app
2. Verify the page shows:
   - Condensed description
   - 4 ownership incentive cards
   - 7 disclosure accordions
3. Click the MessageCircle icon in header
4. **As Non-Admin User:**
   - Post a question
   - See it appear immediately in the list
5. **As Admin User:**
   - See "Respond" button on unanswered questions
   - Post a response
   - See response appear immediately
6. **Test Real-time:**
   - Open app in two browsers/tabs
   - Post question in one → appears in other
   - Post response in one → appears in other

**Production Deployment:**
- Ensure `VITE_ADMIN_USER_ID` is set in production environment variables
- Database migration already applied to Supabase
- No build changes needed
- Feature is production-ready

### Known Limitations (By Design)

These are intentionally NOT implemented (marked as post-MVP in requirements):
- Question upvoting
- Question categories/tags
- Search functionality
- Notifications for responses
- Rich text formatting
- Question threading
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics
- File attachments
- Multi-admin support

### Performance Considerations

- Real-time subscription is lightweight (single channel)
- Questions load on modal open (not on page load)
- Subscription automatically cleaned up on close
- Character limits prevent excessive data transfer
- Proper indexing on database for fast queries

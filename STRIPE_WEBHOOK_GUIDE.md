# Stripe Webhook Configuration & Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the Stripe webhook integration for the Ampel mobile app. The webhook handler processes payment events from Stripe and grants equity shares to users upon successful subscription payment.

**Key Files:**
- Webhook Handler: `/supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- Checkout Session Creator: `/supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- Frontend Checkout: `/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- Success Page: `/src/pages/CheckoutSuccess.tsx`

---

## Architecture

```
User completes payment in embedded checkout
           ↓
  Stripe fires webhook event
           ↓
  Webhook endpoint receives event
           ↓
  Signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
           ↓
  Grant equity shares (100 signup + tier-based subscription)
           ↓
  Mark onboarding complete
           ↓
  Frontend polls for completion
           ↓
  Navigate to chat
```

**Security Principles:**
- ✅ Webhook signature verification prevents unauthorized requests
- ✅ Only webhook grants shares (frontend never grants)
- ✅ Idempotency protection prevents double-granting
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
- ✅ Replay protection (5-minute timestamp window)

---

## Webhook Configuration

### 1. Webhook Endpoint

**URL:** `https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`

**Method:** POST

**Authentication:** Stripe signature verification (not JWT)

**Configuration in `config.toml`:**
```toml
[stripe-webhook]
verify_jwt = false  # Uses Stripe signature verification instead
```

### 2. Events Subscribed

The webhook listens for the following Stripe events:

| Event | Purpose | Handler |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | User completed payment | Grants shares, completes onboarding |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Subscription changed (upgrade/downgrade) | Updates profile subscription status |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Subscription canceled | Marks subscription as canceled |
| `customer.subscription.created` | New subscription created | Records subscription ID |

### 3. Webhook Endpoint Configuration in Stripe Dashboard

**Current Configuration:**
```json
{
  "id": "we_1SNc4OCslnCo4qXAaGmLib7z",
  "url": "https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook",
  "status": "enabled",
  "enabled_events": [
    "checkout.session.completed",
    "customer.subscription.updated",
    "customer.subscription.deleted",
    "customer.subscription.created"
  ]
}
```

**To verify webhook configuration:**
```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints list
```

---

## Webhook Secret Configuration

### 1. Where to Find the Webhook Signing Secret

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
4. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### 2. Configure in Supabase

The webhook signing secret must be stored as a Supabase secret:

```bash
# Set the webhook secret in Supabase
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
```

**Verify secret is set:**
```bash
npx supabase secrets list
```

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret (Supabase secret)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret key (Supabase secret)
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL (function env)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for RLS bypass (function env)

---

## Testing the Webhook

### Method 1: Stripe CLI Trigger (Quick Test)

**Purpose:** Quickly verify webhook endpoint is reachable and signature verification works.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

2. **Authenticate:**
```bash
stripe login --project-name ampel
```

3. **Trigger test event:**
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

4. **Check Supabase logs:**
```bash
# Via MCP tool
mcp__supabase__get_logs --service edge-function

# Expected: 401 response (signature mismatch - this is correct behavior)
```

**Expected Result:**
- Event created in Stripe
- Webhook receives POST request
- Returns 401 (signature verification fails - expected for test events)

**Why 401 is expected:** Test events created by `stripe trigger` are signed with a generic test secret that doesn't match your configured webhook secret. This proves signature verification is working correctly.

### Method 2: Stripe CLI Listen & Forward (Full Test)

**Purpose:** Test with properly signed events that match your webhook secret.

**Steps:**

1. **Start forwarding events:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

This will:
- Create a temporary webhook endpoint
- Forward all events to your Supabase function
- Sign events with the correct secret
- Display events in real-time

2. **In another terminal, trigger an event:**
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

3. **Watch output in the listen terminal:**
```
--> checkout.session.completed [evt_test_...]
<-- [200] POST https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

**Expected Result:**
- 200 response (event processed successfully)
- Logs show successful signature verification
- Event handler logs show processing details

**Note:** Events triggered during `stripe listen` will have test metadata (no real user_id), so the webhook will handle them but won't grant shares to a real user.

### Method 3: End-to-End Testing with Real Checkout

**Purpose:** Test the complete flow from user payment to share granting.

**Prerequisites:**
- Test user with email (not Apple/Google Sign-In for easier testing)
- Completed KYC verification
- Selected subscription tier

**Steps:**

1. **Log in as test user and navigate to checkout page:**
   - Complete onboarding flow
   - Reach `/checkout` page

2. **Use Stripe test card:**
```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/26)
CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 94103)
```

3. **Complete payment in embedded checkout**

4. **Watch the flow:**
   - Payment completes → Navigate to `/checkout-success`
   - Webhook fires (check Supabase logs)
   - Frontend polls database every 1 second
   - `onboarding_completed_at` gets set by webhook
   - Frontend detects completion → Navigate to `/chat`

5. **Verify in database:**
```sql
-- Check profile was updated
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  subscription_status,
  onboarding_completed_at
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user_id_here';

-- Check equity transactions were created
SELECT
  transaction_type,
  shares_amount,
  created_at
FROM equity_transactions
WHERE user_id = 'user_id_here'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check shares balance was updated (via trigger)
SELECT shares_balance
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user_id_here';
```

**Expected Database State:**
```sql
-- Profile
stripe_customer_id: cus_abc123
stripe_subscription_id: sub_xyz789
subscription_status: 'active'
onboarding_completed_at: '2025-10-29T12:34:56.789Z'
shares_balance: 105 (100 signup + 5 for starter tier)

-- Equity Transactions
1. transaction_type: 'signup', shares_amount: 100
2. transaction_type: 'subscription', shares_amount: 5
```

### Method 4: Monitor Live Webhook Events

**Purpose:** Monitor real webhook events in Stripe Dashboard.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click on any event to see:
   - Request body (full event data)
   - Response status and body
   - Retry attempts (if any)
   - Timestamp

**What to look for:**
- ✅ 200 response: Webhook processed successfully
- ⚠️ 401 response: Signature verification failed (check secret configuration)
- ⚠️ 500 response: Internal error (check function logs)
- ⚠️ Retry attempts: Webhook failed, Stripe is retrying

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Webhook Endpoint is Reachable

```bash
# Test with curl (will fail signature verification but proves endpoint is reachable)
curl -X POST https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (signature verification failed)
```

### 2. Verify Webhook Function is Deployed

```bash
npx supabase functions list
```

**Expected output:**
```
stripe-webhook (ID: 65acb811-73e7-4413-a719-08cd70005d44, Status: ACTIVE)
```

### 3. Verify Webhook Events are Subscribed

```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints list
```

**Expected:** Webhook endpoint with all 4 events enabled.

### 4. Verify Webhook Secret is Configured

```bash
npx supabase secrets list
```

**Expected:** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set.

### 5. Verify Signature Verification Works

**Test with invalid signature:**
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

**Check Supabase logs:**
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard or MCP tool
mcp__supabase__get_logs --service edge-function
```

**Expected:** 401 response (proves signature verification is working).

### 6. Verify Event Processing Works

**Test with valid signature (using listen & forward):**
```bash
# Terminal 1
stripe listen --forward-to https://petwhuosomlxehjpthaf.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook

# Terminal 2
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

**Expected:** 200 response in Terminal 1.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook Returns 401 (Unauthorized)

**Cause:** Signature verification failed.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify webhook secret is correct:**
```bash
# Get secret from Stripe Dashboard
stripe webhook_endpoints list

# Update in Supabase
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here

# Redeploy function for secret to take effect
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

2. **Check for secret rotation:**
   - If you recently regenerated the webhook secret in Stripe Dashboard, update it in Supabase

3. **Verify you're using the correct webhook endpoint:**
   - Production webhook endpoint has different secret than test webhook endpoint
   - Make sure secrets match

### Issue: Webhook Returns 500 (Internal Server Error)

**Cause:** Function crashed or threw an error.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check function logs:**
```bash
# Via MCP tool
mcp__supabase__get_logs --service edge-function

# Look for error messages and stack traces
```

2. **Common causes:**
   - Missing environment variable (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, etc.)
   - Database connection error
   - Invalid user_id in event metadata
   - Missing profile for user_id

3. **Fix and redeploy:**
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

### Issue: Webhook Doesn't Receive Events

**Cause:** Webhook endpoint not configured or disabled.

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify endpoint is configured:**
```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints list
```

2. **Check endpoint status:**
   - Status should be "enabled"
   - If disabled, enable in Stripe Dashboard

3. **Verify events are subscribed:**
   - Should have `checkout.session.completed` at minimum
   - Add missing events in Stripe Dashboard

4. **Check Stripe Dashboard event logs:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks > [Your endpoint]
   - Look for delivery attempts and error messages

### Issue: Shares Not Granted

**Cause:** Event processed but shares weren't granted.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check event metadata:**
```bash
# Get event from Stripe
stripe events retrieve evt_...

# Verify metadata contains:
# - user_id: UUID of user
# - tier: 'starter' | 'plus' | 'pro' | 'max'
```

2. **Check user profile exists:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user_id_from_metadata';
```

3. **Check for idempotency block:**
```sql
SELECT onboarding_completed_at
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user_id_from_metadata';

-- If already set, webhook will skip share granting (by design)
```

4. **Check equity_transactions table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM equity_transactions
WHERE user_id = 'user_id_from_metadata'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Should have 2 transactions:
-- 1. signup: 100 shares
-- 2. subscription: 5-40 shares (based on tier)
```

5. **Check shares_balance trigger:**
```sql
-- The trigger should auto-update shares_balance
-- Verify it exists:
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'update_shares_balance_trigger';
```

### Issue: Frontend Stuck on "Processing..."

**Cause:** Webhook completed but frontend polling didn't detect it.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check onboarding_completed_at is set:**
```sql
SELECT onboarding_completed_at
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user_id';
```

2. **If null, webhook didn't complete:**
   - Check Supabase logs for webhook errors
   - Check Stripe Dashboard for webhook delivery failures

3. **If set, frontend polling issue:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify poll interval is running (should log every 1 second)
   - Verify Supabase query is correct

4. **Frontend timeout:**
   - After 30 seconds, frontend redirects anyway
   - Shares will be granted asynchronously

### Issue: Duplicate Share Grants

**Cause:** Webhook processed the same event multiple times.

**Solutions:**

1. **This should NOT happen:** Idempotency check prevents double-granting.

2. **Verify idempotency check is working:**
```typescript
// In stripe-webhook/index.ts
if (profile.onboarding_completed_at) {
  console.log('⚠️ Onboarding already completed, skipping')
  return {
    received: true,
    processed: true,
    error: 'Onboarding already completed'
  }
}
```

3. **Check for race conditions:**
   - Multiple webhook events firing simultaneously
   - Database transaction not committed before second event arrives

4. **Fix if duplicates occurred:**
```sql
-- Identify duplicates
SELECT
  user_id,
  transaction_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM equity_transactions
GROUP BY user_id, transaction_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Remove duplicates (keep earliest)
DELETE FROM equity_transactions
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(id)
  FROM equity_transactions
  GROUP BY user_id, transaction_type
);

-- Recalculate shares_balance
-- (trigger will auto-update on any transaction change)
```

## Monitoring

### Stripe Dashboard

Monitor webhook health in [Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks):

**Key Metrics:**
- Success rate (should be >99%)
- Response time (should be <1 second)
- Error rate (should be <1%)
- Retry attempts (should be minimal)

**Alerts:**
- Set up email alerts for webhook failures
- Monitor error rate spikes

### Supabase Logs

Monitor edge function logs in Supabase Dashboard:

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# Get recent logs
mcp__supabase__get_logs --service edge-function

# Filter for stripe-webhook only
# (Currently not supported, need to filter manually)
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Response codes (should be 200 for valid events)
- Execution time (should be <1 second)
- Error messages (should be none)

### Database Monitoring

Monitor equity_transactions and profiles tables:

```sql
-- Count recent transactions
SELECT
  transaction_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM equity_transactions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY transaction_type;

-- Check for pending onboardings
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM profiles
WHERE
  kyc_status = 'approved'
  AND selected_subscription_tier IS NOT NULL
  AND onboarding_completed_at IS NULL;
-- Should be 0 (no stuck onboardings)

-- Average shares per user
SELECT AVG(shares_balance) as avg_shares
FROM profiles
WHERE onboarding_completed_at IS NOT NULL;
-- Should match expected: 100 (signup) + tier-based
```

## Security Considerations

### Signature Verification

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents unauthorized requests from granting shares
- Ensures events actually come from Stripe
- Protects against replay attacks

**How it works:**
1. Stripe signs each event with HMAC-SHA256
2. Signature includes timestamp and payload
3. Webhook verifies signature matches
4. Rejects events with invalid signatures (401)
5. Rejects events older than 5 minutes (replay protection)

**Code reference:** `/supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts:45-120`

### Idempotency Protection

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents double-granting shares if webhook is called twice
- Stripe may retry failed webhooks
- Network issues can cause duplicate events

**How it works:**
1. Check if `onboarding_completed_at` is already set
2. If set, return early (don't grant shares again)
3. If not set, proceed with share granting
4. Set `onboarding_completed_at` atomically

**Code reference:** `/supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts:321-327`

### Metadata Validation

**Why it matters:**
- Ensures we grant shares to the correct user
- Validates tier is a known value
- Prevents invalid data from corrupting database

**How it works:**
1. Extract `user_id` and `tier` from event metadata
2. Validate `user_id` is a valid UUID
3. Validate `tier` is one of: starter, plus, pro, max
4. Reject events with invalid metadata

**Code reference:** `/supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts:299-317`

### Service Role Key

**Why it matters:**
- Webhook needs to bypass RLS policies
- Regular users can't grant themselves shares
- Only webhook (with service role) can update equity

**How it works:**
1. Webhook uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
2. Service role bypasses all RLS policies
3. Regular users authenticate with anon key (limited permissions)

**Security implications:**
- Service role key must be kept secret
- Never expose service role key to frontend
- Only use in trusted backend functions
